# ChAI â€“ Production-Ready AI Models with Open Source

## ðŸš€ Mission
ChAI aims to bridge the gap between powerful AI models and real-world production use cases. Our repository offers ready-to-use, optimized, and fully deployable solutions based on Open Source technologies.

## âœ¨ Why ChAI?
- **Production Readiness**: Each example is production-tested and optimized.
- **Simplicity & Clarity**: Step-by-step deployment guides with clear documentation.
- **Performance Optimized**: Leverages TensorRT, ONNX, Triton Inference Server, and GPU acceleration.
- **Open Source Commitment**: All examples rely on fully open-source technologies and tools.

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: NVIDIA NeMo, Whisper
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: VITS family models
- **Inference & Deployment**: NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, ONNX Runtime, TensorRT, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Docker-compose, Terraform examples

## ðŸ“Œ Roadmap

### Phase 1: Speech-to-Text Models Integration
- [x] **NeMo ASR English with ONNX & TensorRT optimization** (initial example)
- [ ] Real-time streaming inference examples
- [ ] Whisper multilingual models on Triton Inference Server

### Phase 2: Text-to-Speech Solutions
- [ ] VITS TTS high-quality synthesis setup
- [ ] Deploy VITS family TTS with ONNX & TensorRT
- [ ] Emotion and voice modulation support in TTS models

### Phase 3: Scaling and Cloud Deployment
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment examples with auto-scaling
- [ ] Cloud-native setups on AWS, GCP, Azure
